## Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **Calcul Mobil** (Mobile Computing) course. It is a simple sleep monitoring app built in Kotlin, designed to track movements using the phone's gyroscope and accelerometer. The app allows users to start or stop monitoring and displays the results in charts within the app. Additionally, there is a journal feature where users can log their sleep quality for each day on a calendar.

## Requirements  
- Kotlin (for the project)  
- Android 5.0 or higher (for the app)
